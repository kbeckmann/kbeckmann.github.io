Club Mate is an awesome beverage. Here's how to do it yourself.

# HOWTO FreeMate

### DEPENDENCIES
- Yerba Mate Tea
- Sugar, preferrably dissolved in water
- Lemon Juice
- Carbonated Water

### BUILDING
SuperStrong Mate Tea (1 liter):
- Boil 1 liter water.
- Add 5 tablespoons of Yerba Mate Tea.
- Let it sit for at least 7 minutes.
- Filter it through a coffee filter. This makes it less cloudy.
- Let it cool down and finally put it in the fridge.

Dissolved sugar in water:
- Boil a small amount of water (e.g. 2dl)
- Add sugar until the solution becomes a little bit thicker than water.
- Don't add too much sugar, then it will not be easy to use later.

### INSTALLING
- For each serving of FreeMate:
  - 20% SuperStrong Mate Tea
  - Add as much sugar as required by your system, but don't take too much
  - Add a few dashes of Lemon Juice
  - Mix it well
  - Add Carbonated Water
  - Mix carefully
  - Ready for consumption

### TESTING
- Every now and then, compare your FreeMate installation with a Club Mate. This will let you realize what a fantastic beverage you have created.
