## 

# [sendfile_aes](https://github.com/kbeckmann/sendfile_aes)
Linux kernel module that offers a sendfile()-variant with AES-encryption. It's not production quality and will probably set your computer on fire, but works fine on my machine and offers a tiny amount of higher performance compared with using openssl in userspace. More performance benchmarks needs to be done.

# [ctf](https://github.com/kbeckmann/ctf)
My CTF-games. These are basically [wargames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame_%28hacking%29) where you are supposed to find and read a file/flag using different exploitation techniques.

# [Annalog](https://github.com/kbeckmann/Annalog)
Just a python jabber bot. One of the features is a reddit scraper that finds interesting posts on a set of subreddits and tells the world about them.

# [paincave](https://github.com/simonvik/paincave)
A python websocket service that provides ANT+ data from a USB receiver. Goal is to write a nice web ui and do some cool stuff with it. Focus is on cycling (power, cadence, speed, heart rate).
